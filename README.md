## Overview

Heart failure is a severe condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. Early prediction of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify patients at risk of heart failure.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains clinical features of patients, such as age, sex, ejection fraction, serum creatinine levels, and more. The dataset can be found in the `data` directory. It is crucial to ensure the data is preprocessed correctly before training the model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages and libraries:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)
  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-failure-prediction.git
   cd heart-failure-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset is in the `data` directory.

2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. Train the model using the prepared data:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model performance:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. (Optional) Run the Jupyter Notebook to interactively explore the data and results:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Failure_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The trained model achieves a high accuracy and recall in predicting heart failure. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the `Heart_Failure_Prediction.ipynb` file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style and include relevant tests.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the contributors and the community for their valuable input and support. Special thanks to the providers of the dataset for making this project possible.
